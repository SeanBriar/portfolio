<!--
We are going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. We have all of the ingredients because we just went to the store. First I am going to take out two slices of bread. Then I will take out the peanut butter and jelly. Finally, I will find a knife in the kitchen. If all of the knives are dirty I will clean one out of the wash.
Next, I will place the bread on the table. Then I will spread the peanut butter with the knife. I will check to see if all corners are evenly covered. If they are, continue to grabbing jelly. If not, while the peanut butter is not smooth, I will keep adding peanut butter. When the peanut butter is spread,
I will start adding the jelly. I will spread the jelly untill it is fully spread. If the jelly is not fully spread, keep spreading. Else put both pieces together and you have a sandwhich!
