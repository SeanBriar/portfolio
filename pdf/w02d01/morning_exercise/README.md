During last morning exercise we built out the html for our blog that had this mockup:


# Activity

## Create This Mockup
 ![Mockup](https://imgur.com/o06G8j2.png)
- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML lab so it looks like the mockup.

## Getting Started
1) You already created the HTML for this mockup last morning exercise. You should have created it in your `w01d05/morning_exercise` folder. We called it `index.html`.

2. Let's copy your work into your `student_examples` folder for today.

- In terminal:
 - navigate to your `/w02d01/morning_exercise` folder
 - create a new folder called `morning_mockup`
 - navigate inside `morning_mockup`
 - from there type `cp ../../../w01d05/morning_exercise/*.html .` NOTE: if you created more files than this (like a CSS file), you will also need to copy those files.
 - This command will copy all `html` files from Friday's folder into today's `morning_exercise` folder

 Note: if you have created your files elsewhere, you will need to adjust the path!

 Note: if you struggled making the html, we've included an `sample_index.html` for you to work off of in this folder.

## Hungry For More?:

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
2. Style the site further to make it look more professional (e.g. style the navigation and footer links differently)!
3. If you didn't do the doggie mockup last time, do it now! If you did do the HTML mockup for it, but didn't get to the CSS, do it now!
