## Sean Briar - Portfolio v.2

This is my portfolio with a short bio about me, a collection of my work, and contact information. One can also find links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts, as well as my Resume. It was build with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

The design for this portfolio is currently on version 2. I would like to use this portfolio as a way to continue to expand my design skills and experiement with new techniques. Below you can see pictures of previous versions:
